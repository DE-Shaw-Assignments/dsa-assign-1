## Question-2 (k-th Largest Element)

### Using Quickselect Approach

- Submission Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/submissions/1148371798
- Didn't pass all test cases on leetcode as one testcase is worst case for time complexity.
- Time Complexity - O(n) (Average and Best case) but O(n^2) (Worst Case)
- Space Complexity - O(1)
- Explanation - I initialized the left and right boundaries of the array.I selected right boundary as a pivot element. Then elements smaller than the pivot are moved to its left, and larger elements to its right. The algorithm then checks the position of the pivot. If it matches the desired k-th largest index, the pivot is returned. Otherwise, the algorithm adjusts the boundaries based on the pivot's position, either narrowing down the search space to the left or right, and repeats the process until the k-th largest element is identified. QuickSelect's efficiency lies in its ability to selectively recurse into one half of the data, making it particularly advantageous for scenarios with large datasets.

### Using Heap (Priority Queue)

- Submission Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/submissions/1148365508
- Passed all test cases
- Time Complexity - O(nlogk)
- Space Complexity - O(k)
- Explanation - I maintained a priority-queue (heap) of k elements and as I iterated across elements of n sized array i ensured that only largest k elements encounterred till now remain in the heap. So after iterating through whole array the top element of the priority queue will be the smallest element among largest k elements of the array.

### Using STL

- Submission Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/submissions/1148381898
- Passed all test cases
- Time Complexity - O(nlogk)
- Space Complexity - O(1)
- Explanation - There is a function named nth_element in C++ STL. I used that to retrieve the kth largest element in the array.

## Question-3 (3-Sum Closet)

- Submission Link - https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/submissions/1149059401
- Passed all test cases
- Time Complexity - O(n^2)
- Space Complexity - O(1)
- Explanation - First sort the given vector and then iterate over the vector we get a new target sum i.e target-current value ,now we use the two pointer approach to get the closest possible value to the new target and keep updating the answer when the absolute diiference of answer is greater than the current totalsum i.e. newtarget + current value.
